Take all myself.
And for that name, which is no part of thee,
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
By any other name would smell as sweet.
What's in a name? That which we call a rose
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
